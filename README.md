# Very Basic Login System

Its a very simple and not a very secure login system. Uses express server as backend and mongodb for storing data. I've also used native js, html and css for the frontend of this login system, which uses fetch for api fetches.




## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/chinmayraj28/login-system.git
```

Go to the backend project directory

```bash
  cd your-project-name
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server

```bash
  npm run start
```

This will turn the server on. Running on local host port 3000. You can also change this in the source code.
